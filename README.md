# DengAI
he problem was taken from a competition hosted by DrivenData foundation to predict the total number of dengue patients using historical climate and non-climate data for the given cities. Machine learning algorithms like Negative Binomial, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor are used to train the model and predicted the dengue cases.
